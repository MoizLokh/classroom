If you have any questions regarding the assignments, please [post them on Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/kszjgsicx1m5np). Unless your question contains personal information, it will be made public for the benefit of your classmates. For each assignment, we will have 2 TAs serving as main points of contact, from whom you can expect to receive an answer (other TAs can chime in too, of course).
